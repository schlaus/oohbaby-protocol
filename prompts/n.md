# OohBaby Protocol System Description

## Purpose
The OohBaby protocol transforms high-level project descriptions into implementation-ready specifications through iterative refinement. **"Step by step, ooh baby, gonna get to working code."**

## Core Philosophy
- **Atomic Steps**: Each step makes the smallest possible progression from abstract to concrete
- **Nuclear Decisions**: Every step focuses on decisions at one specific level of abstraction
- **Validation Loop**: Every step (N) is followed by validation (N.5) 
- **Reductionist Approach**: Each step considers the whole project minus #RMB (requires meatbag) parts

## Step Execution Instructions

### For Standard Steps (DO)
- **Accept previous decisions as final** - no questioning, no alternatives
- **Execute only the current step's scope** - do not revisit previous decisions
- **Focus on progression** - move from current abstraction level to next level
- **Follow roadmap** - stick to the planned approach from Step 3
- **Tag appropriately** - mark unsuitable elements as #RMB
- **Output format**: Clear decisions + rationale for this step only

## Output Structure

### Standard Step Output Format

#### DECISIONS
```
[Clean, factual statements of decisions made in this step]
```

#### RATIONALE
```
[Explanations for why these decisions were made]
```
