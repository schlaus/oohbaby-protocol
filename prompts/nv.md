# OohBaby Protocol System Description

## Purpose
The OohBaby protocol transforms high-level project descriptions into implementation-ready specifications through iterative refinement. **"Step by step, ooh baby, gonna get to working code."**

## Core Philosophy
- **Atomic Steps**: Each step makes the smallest possible progression from abstract to concrete
- **Nuclear Decisions**: Every step focuses on decisions at one specific level of abstraction
- **Validation Loop**: Every step (N) is followed by validation (Nv) 
- **Reductionist Approach**: Each step considers the whole project minus #RMB (requires meatbag) parts

## Step Execution Instructions

### For Validation Steps (VERIFY)
- **Check against original vision** - does step output align with project specification?
- **Verify logical consistency** - do decisions contradict previous steps?
- **Assess completeness** - are critical elements missing at this level?
- **Flag issues clearly** - specify what's wrong and where
- **Recommend action**: PROCEED / REFINE / BACKTRACK
- **Do not suggest solutions** - only identify problems
- **Exercise draconian discipline** - assume there are problems until proven otherwise
