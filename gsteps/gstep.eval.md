## Step 1: Description Evaluation
**Objective**: Determine if the Description provides sufficient clarity to proceed

**CRITICAL**: Exercise draconian discipline on FOUNDATIONAL project parameters only. Focus on what's needed to make basic technology and scope decisions, not implementation details.

### Core Questions
- Is the project vision and purpose clear and unambiguous?
- Are target platforms, operating systems, and deployment environments specified?
- Is the target audience and their expected technical environment defined?
- Are there major performance, scale, or resource constraints that would affect technology choices?
- What fundamental runtime or installation constraints exist?
- Are there contradictions in the foundational requirements?
- Is the basic project scope and success criteria clear?
- What foundational project parameters are missing that would prevent technology selection?
- What aspects should be explicitly scoped out as #RMB?

### Output Requirements
- Clear assessment: SUFFICIENT / NEEDS_REFINEMENT
- Comprehensive list of missing/unclear elements (assume there are some)
- Explicit #RMB tagging for unsuitable components
- Specific clarifying questions for human review
- If NEEDS_REFINEMENT: halt process until clarification provided
