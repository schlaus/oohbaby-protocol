## Step 1: Description Evaluation
**Objective**: Determine if the Description provides sufficient clarity to proceed

**CRITICAL**: Exercise draconian discipline. Assume the description is incomplete until proven otherwise. No yes-man-ism. Flag ANY missing information, no matter how seemingly obvious.

### Core Questions
- Is the project vision clear and unambiguous?
- Are target platforms, operating systems, and deployment environments specified?
- Is the target audience and their expected technical environment defined?
- Are performance, scale, and resource requirements clearly stated?
- What runtime dependencies and installation constraints exist?
- What critical information is missing or unclear?
- What assumptions would need to be made to proceed?
- What aspects should be explicitly scoped out as #RMB?
- Are there contradictions or conflicting requirements in the Description?
- Is the success criteria and definition of "done" clear?

### Output Requirements
- Clear assessment: SUFFICIENT / NEEDS_REFINEMENT
- Comprehensive list of missing/unclear elements (assume there are some)
- Explicit #RMB tagging for unsuitable components
- Specific clarifying questions for human review
- If NEEDS_REFINEMENT: halt process until clarification provided
