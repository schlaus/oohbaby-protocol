### Step 1v: Validation of Description Evaluation
**Objective**: Verify the thoroughness and accuracy of Step 1's completeness assessment

**CRITICAL**: Exercise draconian discipline. Assume there are problems until proven otherwise. Be ruthlessly critical, not accommodating.

#### Validation Questions
- Did Step 1 identify all missing project parameters?
- Was the assessment of clarity accurate and complete?
- Are there additional gaps that were missed?
- Did Step 1 make any unwarranted assumptions?
- Is the SUFFICIENT/NEEDS_REFINEMENT decision justified?
- Were all contradictions and ambiguities properly flagged?
