### Step 2v: Validation of Technology Requirements
**Objective**: Verify technology analysis completeness and accuracy

**CRITICAL**: Exercise draconian discipline. Be ruthlessly critical of the technology analysis.

#### Validation Questions
- Did Step 2 identify all technology constraints and requirements?
- Are there missing platform or environment considerations?
- Were integration requirements properly analyzed?
- Are there unstated performance implications that were missed?
- Did the analysis make unwarranted technology assumptions?
- Are additional technical clarifications needed?
