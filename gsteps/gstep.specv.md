### Step 3v: Fidelity Check of Project Specification
**Objective**: Verify the structured specification maintains fidelity to original project vision

**CRITICAL**: Exercise draconian discipline. Ensure no requirements drift occurred during restructuring.

#### Validation Questions
- Does the structured specification accurately reflect the original description?
- Were any requirements lost, added, or modified during restructuring?
- Did assumptions creep in that weren't in the original vision?
- Is the specification still true to the project's intended purpose?
- Are all original requirements properly represented?
- Did the structuring process introduce any contradictions?
