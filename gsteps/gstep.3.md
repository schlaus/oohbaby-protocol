## Step 3: Roadmap Generation
**Objective**: Estimate project complexity and plan remaining refinement steps

### Core Questions
- How many additional steps are needed to reach implementation specs?
- What are the major phases/milestones in this progression?
- Where are the likely complexity bottlenecks?
- Which aspects will require the most detailed refinement?
- Are there any steps that might need silo subdivision?

### Output Requirements
- Total step estimate (Steps 4 through N)
- Phase breakdown with step ranges
- Complexity assessment for each phase
- Roadmap for progression from current state to implementation-ready specs
- Identification of potential silo candidates
