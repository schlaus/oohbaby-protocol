# OohBaby Protocol System Description

## Purpose
The OohBaby protocol transforms high-level project descriptions into implementation-ready specifications through iterative refinement. **"Step by step, ooh baby, gonna get to working code."**

## Core Philosophy
- **Atomic Steps**: Each step makes the smallest possible progression from abstract to concrete
- **Nuclear Decisions**: Every step focuses on decisions at one specific level of abstraction
- **Validation Loop**: Every step (N) is followed by validation (Nv) 
- **Reductionist Approach**: Each step considers the whole project minus #RMB (requires meatbag) parts

## Process Flow
1. **Description** â†’ Structured project understanding (predefined steps)
2. **Step-by-step refinement** with validation checkpoints (numbered steps)
3. **Automatic backtracking** when validation fails within retry limits
4. **Implementation specifications** as final output

## Step Structure

### Predefined Steps (Project Analysis Phase)
- **Eval**: Evaluate description completeness and foundational clarity
- **Tech**: Analyze technology constraints and requirements  
- **Spec**: Generate structured project specification
- Each predefined step followed by validation (evalv, techv, specv)

### Numbered Steps (Implementation Design Phase)
- **Input**: Project specification + previous step decisions
- **Process**: Make decisions at current abstraction level
- **Output**: New decisions + rationale for this step only
- **Scope**: Whole project minus #RMB tagged components

### Validation Steps (Nv)
- Compare step output against project specification
- Check logical consistency with previous steps
- Flag contradictions or missing elements
- Recommend: PROCEED / REFINE / BACKTRACK
- Project-agnostic validation focusing on step quality, not domain specifics

## Silo Mechanics

### When to Use Siloes
Siloes are only valid when all criteria are met:
- **Clear separation**: Distinct problem domains that can be analyzed independently
- **No cross-constraints**: Decisions in silo A won't limit options in silo B at this abstraction level
- **Sufficient complexity**: Each silo has enough depth to justify separate analysis  
- **Current-step independence**: Siloes won't interact during the next atomic progression
- **"Clear as day" test**: If there's any doubt about independence, don't split

### Silo Structure
- **Main file** (`step.N.md`): Common decisions + split rationale
- **Silo files** (`step.N.aspect.md`): Aspect-specific analysis
- **Validation**: Main + each silo gets separate Nv validation

### Silo Lifecycle
- **Creation**: When complexity demands subdivision AND independence criteria are met
- **Continuation**: Silo persists if still relevant and independent
- **Termination**: When silo reaches natural conclusion
- **Revival**: Restart silo if topic becomes relevant again
- **Merge**: Single remaining silo becomes main step again

## Automatic Backtracking

### Configuration Parameters
- **max_backtrack_steps**: How far back agent can automatically go (e.g., 3 steps)
- **max_retries_per_step**: How many attempts before human intervention (e.g., 3 tries)

### Retry Documentation
- Failed attempts documented in `step.N.attempts.md`
- Failure modes fed to executor: "Previous attempts failed for these reasons, do not repeat these approaches"
- Smart cleanup: When backtracking past a step, nuke its attempt history (context changed)

### Escalation
- Automatic recovery for validation failures within retry limits
- Human intervention only when truly stuck or retry limits exceeded

## Step Progression Questions

### Percentage-Based Checkpoints
- **p50 (halfway)**: Progress alignment with original vision, architectural drift check
- **p75 (reality check)**: Feasibility assessment, scope adjustment evaluation

### Question Positioning
Questions marked with positioning comments:
- `<!-- Step:5 -->` = absolute positioning (always step 5)
- `<!-- Step:0.5 -->` = relative positioning (50% through total steps)
- No comment = relative positioning based on question library phase

## Key Principles

### For Each Step
- Build on previous decisions without re-explaining them
- Focus only on current abstraction level
- Tag unsuitable elements as #RMB
- Consider whole project scope at current detail level
- Provide clear rationale for decisions made

### File Organization
- One file per step/silo for clean separation
- Git-based versioning with auto-commit/push for backtracking
- Clear input/output boundaries between steps
- Filename format: `step.N.md` or `step.N.aspect.md`

### Step Execution Instructions

#### For Standard Steps (DO)
- **Accept previous decisions as final** - no questioning, no alternatives
- **Execute only the current step's scope** - do not revisit previous decisions
- **Focus on progression** - move from current abstraction level to next level
- **Follow roadmap** - stick to the planned approach from Spec step
- **Tag appropriately** - mark unsuitable elements as #RMB
- **Output format**: Clear decisions + rationale for this step only

#### For Validation Steps (VERIFY)
- **Check against project specification** - does step output align with requirements?
- **Verify logical consistency** - do decisions contradict previous steps?
- **Assess completeness** - are critical elements missing at this level?
- **Flag issues clearly** - specify what's wrong and where
- **Recommend action**: PROCEED / REFINE / BACKTRACK
- **Do not suggest solutions** - only identify problems
- **Exercise draconian discipline** - assume there are problems until proven otherwise
- **Stay project-agnostic** - focus on step quality, not domain expertise
